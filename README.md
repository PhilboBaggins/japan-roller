Japan Roller
============

When you're holidaying in Germany, you have [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxKivzjCFNg) to tell you want to do but when you're holidaying in Japan there is nothing! I wrote this app to solve this problem and to absolve the user of all responsibility for deciding what to do with their life while on holiday in Japan.

Just choose what situation you are currently in (day time, night time, looking for food or looking for an adult beverage) and then shake your phone to receive instructions on what to do next.
